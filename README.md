# POLICY EVALUATION

REGISTER NUMBER :212222240057
NAME:MAHALAKSHMI K

AIM :
To develop a Python program to evaluate the given policy by maximizing its cumulative reward while dealing with slippery terrain.

PROBLEM STATEMENT :
We are assigned with the task of creating an RL agent to solve the "Bandit Slippery Walk" problem. The environment consists of Seven states representing discrete positions the agent can occupy. The agent must learn to navigate this environment while dealing with the challenge of slippery terrain. Slippery terrain introduces stochasticity in the agent's actions, making it difficult to predict the outcomes of its actions accurately.

States :
The environment has 7 states :

Two Terminal States: G: The goal state & H: A hole state.
Five Transition states / Non-terminal States including S: The starting state.

Actions :
The agent can take two actions:

R -> Move right.
L -> Move left.

Transition Probabilities :
The transition probabilities for each action are as follows:

50% chance that the agent moves in the intended direction.
33.33% chance that the agent stays in its current state.
16.66% chance that the agent moves in the opposite direction.

Rewards :
The agent receives a reward of +1 for reaching the goal state (G).
The agent receives a reward of 0 for all other states.
